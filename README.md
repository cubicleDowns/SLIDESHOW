Slideshow tips, links and topics for use in parallel with a presentation.  Sorta like footnotes, but viewed in parallel to a presentation.

Features:
* Associate external material to a live presentation page.
* Allow users to browse through material during and after presentation.
* Firebase linkage keeps the SLIDESHOW synced to the same page.
  * This is disabled currently to do Firebase expense for synchronous connections
